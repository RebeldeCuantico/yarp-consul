# yarp-consul

I have developed a project that integrates [YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/) and [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) using .NET 7 and C# 11. This integration enables seamless communication between the YARP reverse proxy and Consul service discovery and configuration management platform. With the power of YARP's dynamic routing capabilities and Consul's robust service registry, our project simplifies the deployment and management of microservices in a distributed environment. Leveraging the latest features of .NET 7 and C# 11, we have created a reliable and efficient solution for building resilient and scalable applications with YARP and Consul.
